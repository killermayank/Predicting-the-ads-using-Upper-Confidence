# Predicting-the-ads-using-Upper-Confidence
Predict the ads to the users which will be most beneficial to show on the basis reward using  Upper Confidence Bound (Reinforcement learning ) 

Dataset contain a list of 7500 users which is likely to click on ads, we used two algorithm as on the basis random_algorithm we randomly
took ads and predicted reward so on the basis of random algorith we achieved the reward of 1200 approx.Next using this dataset again implementing to the upper bound confidence algorithm achieved the reward to 2100

This histogram is based on the random algortihm
